Diesel PBRT

Extends the PBRT API Framework By Restructuring the Static Pipeline Approach to PBRT rendering process to make the process configurable and usable in external environments

We also have Paralllezation/SIMD/GPU Raster Graphics and Taskflows in Mind

PBRT is an excellent system for scene generation / Scene Descriptions are clean concise and configurable. We prefer to use this as 
our go to Graphics API.
